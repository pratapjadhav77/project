# Customerretantionandcohortanlysis
The project aims to predict and prevent customer churn rate of a given company, by using Machine learning and Advance data analytics. We will achieve the above objective by dividing the customers into multiple cohorts based on their behavior and building an ML model on top of it. This will help businesses develop strategies to get resulting greater retention of customers. We have downloaded dataset from kaggle 
refer: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/auto-insurance-churn-analysis-dataset?select=termination.csv) using different Machine Learning Algorithms namely
1.	Decision tree classifier Algorithm.
2.	Random Forest classifier Algorithm.
3.	XGBClassifier Algorithm.
Using the above algorithms and feature engineering we can predict the customer retention for the dataset, Although the dataset lacks data and is incomplete in some manner and it is understood that Sales data is confidential and organizations do not usually share the data directly, best efforts have been put to analyze the dataset statistically.
